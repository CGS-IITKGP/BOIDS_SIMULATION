This project demonstrates the simulation of BOIDS using C++ and the raylib graphics library. BOIDS, short for “bird-oid objects,” is a model introduced by Craig Reynolds to simulate the natural flocking behavior seen in groups of birds, fish, or other animals. The system is governed by three core rules: separation (avoiding crowding neighbors), alignment (matching the average direction of nearby boids), and cohesion (moving toward the average position of the group). By applying these simple principles at each frame, complex and lifelike group movement emerges. Raylib is used to render the boids in real time, handle user input, and manage the simulation loop, resulting in an interactive and visually engaging representation of collective motion.

The rules are :

Seperation which makes two boids coming to close to each other move apart.

Alignment which makes a group of neighbouring boids move in the same direction.

Cohesion which causes the nearby boids to try to move towards their respective centre.

## Getting Started

To set up a local instance of the application, follow the steps below.


### Installation

_Now that the environment has been set up and configured to properly compile and run the project, the next step is to install and configure the project locally on your system._
<!-- UPDATE -->
1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git https://github.com/blaZe2603/BOIDS_SIMULATION.git
   ```
2. Make the script executable
   ```sh
   cd ./PROJECT_NAME
   chmod +x ./PROJECT_NAME
   ```
3. Execute the script
   ```sh
   press f5 
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
<!-- UPDATE -->
This project simulates **boid flocking behavior** in C++ using simple rules for separation, alignment, and cohesion.  
It can be used to visualize swarm intelligence, simulate bird flocks, or model fish schools.
